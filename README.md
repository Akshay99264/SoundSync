# Evaluation-of-Audio-Quality-and-Speech-Intelligibility-Using-PESQ-MSE-STOI-WER-and-CER-Metrics
This project compares audio quality and intelligibility using standardized metrics: PESQ, MSE, STOI, WER, and CER. It evaluates the impact of audio processing techniques like noise removal and enhancement, providing insights for improving speech quality in applications like VoIP and speech recognition systems.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `home.py` ‚Äì Main script to launch the application and display audio details.
- `preprocessingAudio.py` ‚Äì Handles preprocessing of audio files.
- `extractSpeech.py` ‚Äì Extracts speech segments and logs relevant parameters.
- `MSE.py` ‚Äì Calculates Mean Squared Error; handles cases when score can't be computed.
- `PESQ.py` ‚Äì Computes PESQ (Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality) scores.
- `STOI.py` ‚Äì Computes Short-Time Objective Intelligibility.
- `WER_CER.py` ‚Äì Calculates Word Error Rate (WER) and Character Error Rate (CER).
- `convertCSVtoSTR.py` ‚Äì Converts CSV files to string format.
- `requirements.txt` ‚Äì List of all dependencies needed to run the project.
